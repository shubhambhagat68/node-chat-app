# node-chat-app

This Project Uses Basic Implementation of Socket.io on Client and Server Side.

User can join a room, i have implemented validation so no room can have two users with same.
Users can chat in a room and joining and leaving if of user will be seen by other users who are present in the room.
Users can also send thier live location.

I have used some validation so no one can send Profanity message to chat room.
